# Bolt

> Super-powered JavaScript project management

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boltpkg/bolt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/boltpkg/bolt)

### Introduction

Are you sharing components, libraries or services between different projects and
find it difficult to manage? Juggling lots of Node packages in lots of different
repositories? What if there was a better way?

![Diagram: One package per project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boltpkg/assets/master/diagram-multirepo.png)

Most JavaScript projects have 1 package per project (repo). So when you have
lots of packages, you have to do a lot of work to manage them all:

- You need to install every single package one by one.
- If you make changes to one package and want to test them in another, you need
  to manually link them together and run tests separately.
- Managing dependencies and keeping everything up to date can be overwhelming,
  and you can easily fall really far behind.

Instead of all that, what if you put all of your packages together?

![Diagram: Project with many packages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boltpkg/assets/master/diagram-monorepo.png)

This is the idea behind "workspaces".

#### What are workspaces?

A _workspace_ is like any other node package: It's just a directory with its
own `package.json`.

Workspaces are grouped into a single "project". A _project_ is also just a
node package at the root of your repository. This is sometimes referred to
as a "monorepo", but we prefer the term "multi-package repo".

```
project
├── package.json
├── workspace-one
│   ├── package.json
│   └── index.js
└── workspace-two
    ├── package.json
    └── index.js
```

Put another way, workspaces are just like any other package, except they are
nested within a larger project/repo. Each workspace can have its own dependencies
with its own code and scripts. Workspaces can also be grouped into
sub-directories for further organization.

Using Bolt, you can install the dependencies for all of these packages at once
(and you can do it really really fast).

But here's where it gets really cool: When you specify a dependency from one
workspace to another. It will get linked to the actual source. This way, when
you go to test your code. All your changes get tested together.

> **Note:** This idea is not new, other tools like [Lerna](https://lernajs.io)

#### What is Bolt?

Bolt implements the idea of workspaces on top of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
In fact, the Bolt CLI is largely a drop-in replacement of the Yarn CLI. You can
use it on any project already using Yarn.

But Bolt (will soon) do lots of other stuff. Instead of wasting tons of time
setting up a whole bunch of build tools for running your tests, or compiling
your code, what if your package manager just did all that for you? Then when
you want to do something differently, all you need to do is override a script.

Well that's what Bolt will do for you (once we get around to implementing it).

Long term, many of the features in Bolt will hopefully prove to be useful and
other package managers like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) will adopt them.

## Installation

First be sure that you have [Node/npm](https://nodejs.org/) and
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install/) installed. Then run the following
command:

```sh
yarn global add bolt
```

## Configuration

Bolt config is in the root `package.json`.

For examples, for declaring workspaces in sub-directories:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "bolt": {
    "workspaces": [
      "utils/*",
      "apps/*"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Passing flags to run commands

Depending on your needs you might run a script in one of many ways.

```
bolt script
bolt run script
bolt p run script
bolt w package run script
bolt ws --only="my-package" run script
bolt ws exec --only="my-package" -- yarn script
```

Similar to later versions of yarn, you can also call a script with extra flags:

```
bolt script --flag1 --flag2
bolt run script --flag1 --flag2
bolt p run script --flag1 --flag2
bolt w my-package run script --flag1 --flag2
bolt ws --only="my-package" run script -- --flag1 --flag2
bolt ws exec --only="my-package" -- yarn script  --flag1 --flag2
```

The only slightly surprising one might be the `ws run` command where you'll notice you need to add in the extra `--` flag to pass in flags. This is to avoid ambiguity in which flags are meant for bolt and which are meant for your script.
