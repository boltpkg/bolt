# pyarn

pyarn is a super-powered wrapper around [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) that provides you with useful commands for
working with your projects. The hope in the future is that a lot of these ideas
will make it back into Yarn and/or npm.

## Installation

First be sure that you have [Node/npm](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install/) installed. Then run the following command:

```sh
yarn global add pyarn
```
